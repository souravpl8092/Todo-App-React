# TODO APP

A todo app (or task manager app) is a software application that allows users to manage and organize their tasks and to-do lists. They can help users keep track of what they need to do, when they need to do it, and how much progress they have made on specific tasks.

Todo apps have a basic set of features such as the ability to create tasks, set reminders, and mark tasks as complete. Some also allow you to set due dates, priorities and add notes or subtasks.

Todo apps also include features such as the ability to share tasks with others or to synchronize tasks across multiple devices. This can be particularly useful for people who are working on a project with others or for those who use multiple devices throughout the day.
